#
what
$
Array is a collection of data with same type.

$type
Basically, array can be declared as any data type.

#
how
$create,declare
To create an array, you need to use the syntax as below:
	int num[10];
Note: 'int' specifies what kind of data type that the array stores, 'num' indicates the name of array, '10' means the size of array

$length,size
Using sizeof(array)/sizeof(data type of array) 
Example:
arr = int[2] 
length = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int)

$use,access
You can access individual element of the array by using the array name and index in the same way you would use any other variable
Example:
num[2] = 42

#
why
$use
Improve efficiency when manipulating multiple data with same type.
